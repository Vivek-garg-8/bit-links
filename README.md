## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your machine.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.18.0 or later recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/bit-links.git](https://github.com/your-username/bit-links.git)
    cd bit-links
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below for details.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üîë Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

`MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string. This is used to connect to your database where the URL mappings are stored.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST`: The public URL of your application. For local development, this will be `http://localhost:3000`.

**Example `.env.local` file:**

```env
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/bitlinks?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
```
> **Note:** Replace the `MONGODB_URI` value with your actual MongoDB connection string. If you are running MongoDB locally, it might look like `mongodb://localhost:27017/bitlinks`.

## üì¶ API Endpoints

The primary API endpoint for creating short links is:

### `POST /api/generate`

This endpoint creates a new short URL and stores it in the database.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
